\multicolumn{2}{p{.7\linewidth}}{\footnotesize This table presents results from the test proposed in Frandsen, Lefgren, and Leslie (2020) for the joint null hypothesis that the monotonicity and exclusion restrictions hold.  A failure to reject the null implies that we cannot reject the hypothesis that the monotonicity and exclusion restrictions jointly hold. This test was implemented in Stata via the package testjfe (Frandsen, 2020).}\\

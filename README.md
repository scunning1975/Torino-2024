# Unconfoundedness and Regression Discontinuity Course Syllabus

## Course Information
**Course Title**: Unconfoundedness and Regression Discontinuity

**Dates**: Monday, June 3rd to Friday, June 7th

**Instructor**: Dr. Scott Cunningham

**Preferred Email**: scunning@gmail.com

**Website**: [Scott Cunningham's Website](https://www.scunning.com)

**Note**: This syllabus may change, but I am making an effort to keep it fixed.

## Course Description
Unconfoundedness is a collection of methods used when selection into treatment occurs through a set of known and quantified confounders. These methods can involve a collection of covariates satisfying overlap conditions or a running variable as in regression discontinuity design. This week, we will explore both methods, focusing on heterogeneous treatment effects, regression, and matching using both coding examples and lectures.

## Prerequisites
Econometrics or equivalent.

## Course Objectives
- Develop comprehension of causal inference as a theoretical field.
- Build confidence in understanding and applying the methods to data.
- Gain competency in using modern statistical software to implement the methods practically.

## Required and Supplemental Textbooks
**Required**:  
- Cunningham, Scott. _Causal Inference: the Mixtape_ (Yale University Press). Available for free on [Scott Cunningham's website](https://mixtape.scunning.com).

## Classwork and Final Grade
- **Crits**: Three assignments where you will critique podcast interviews with winners of the 2021 Nobel Prize in Economics. 
- **Class Participation**: Come to class, take notes, read the lecture slides ahead of time, read the chapters in the Mixtape
